	<description>(Based on the idea behind A14 mod "Grenade Fix" by TheFlameTouched)

This mod dynamically injects a minimum range to any weapon with an explosive projectile:
Grenades, launchers and even items added by mods.*

The minimum range is slightly larger than the weapon's explosion radius, ensuring that pawns won't explode themselves by accident.

*If the weapon already has a safe minimum range (e.g. mortars) it will not be affected.</description>

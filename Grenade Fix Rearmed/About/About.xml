	<description>This mod dynamically injects a minimum range to any weapon with an explosive projectile.

Affects grenades, launchers, etc. including weapons added by mods.*

The minimum range is slightly larger than the weapon's explosion radius, ensuring that pawns won't explode themselves by accident.

*If the weapon already has a safe minimum range (e.g. mortars) it will not be affected.</description>

Injects a minimum range to any weapon with an explosive projectile.

![Description](https://i.imgur.com/OG6xUzd.png)

This mod dynamically injects a minimum range to any weapon with an explosive projectile.

Affects grenades, launchers, etc. including weapons added by mods.

The minimum range is slightly larger than the weapon's explosion radius, ensuring that pawns won't explode themselves by accident.

![Notes](https://i.imgur.com/GSbppLC.png)

If a weapon already has a safe minimum range (e.g. mortars) it will not be affected.
